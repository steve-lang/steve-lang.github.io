    <p id="ar-sectional"> Thousands of homeless dogs roam the streets in this community. are injured or caring for young litters of puppies. We open our doors to dogs in need and provide them with food, shelter, veterinary care, and a place to call home, for however long they need.We give them hope. Please join us. </p>
    <p>Barb’s Dog Rescue started in 2001 with one woman’s concern for the thousands of homeless dogs Puerto Penasco, Mexico. </p>
    <p> It’s hard to say no to moms with young puppies or injured dogs who would struggle to survive if left on the streets. As word about our shelter has spread our doors have been busier and busier. <em> just a small shelter run by Barb alone, we now house over 200 dogs and puppies on any given day, with a team of staff and dedicated volunteers.</em></p>     
    <p>Because there are not enough people looking to adopt in the Puerto Penasco community,"> with rescue groups in the United States to place adoptable dogs.For those that have been severely traumatized, Barb’s Dog Rescue will be their permanent sanctuary, and they will live out their lives knowing they are safe from the challenges of living on the streets.</p>
